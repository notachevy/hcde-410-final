# hcde-410-final
The final project for Nathan Ford's partaking in the University of Washington class Human Centered Design Engineering 410 - The Human Data Interaction (HCDE 410).

The project focuses on answering the question: What field (of those listed on the Our World in Data page) has the highest correlation to a country's educational success as measured by the PISA? What are potential causes of this relationship if it is causal?

The project draws primarily from the webpages on "Our World in Data" that discuss global education in relation to PISA scores.

To answer the question above, a linear regression will be done to determine the correlation between a given field and its relationship with the country's PISA score. Once the regression is complete, a chart will be produced that shows the correlation strength and direction for each field. Creating this chart will highlight fields that do not appear correlated to a country's PISA score as well as those that positively and negatively impact a country's PISA score. With key fields highlighted, further research can be done to determine if a relationship is causal, and if so, what causes it. After determining causality, funds can be diverted from fields that hurt or do not help education into fields that positively impact education.
